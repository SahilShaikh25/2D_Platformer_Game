# 2D Platformer Game (Lost In The Abyss)

This is my final year project. I developed a 2D platformer game from the scratch.






## About Game 🎮 
"Lost In The Abyss" is a single player platformer game developed using the pygame library of python programming language. 

SQLite3 is used for storing the game data. Since SQLite3 is lightweight, it was an optimal choice for my game.

## Gameplay Guide 📒
The game is quite simple 🤷‍♂️. You have to travel from left  to right ➡️ side of the map. Inbetween you will find 🔎 some foes 🤺 whom you have to defeat. There's also hidden treasure 💎 somewhere on the map so, keep an eye out for that.

In each level you can earn stars 🌟 by completing following tasks :

⭐ - Complete the level.

⭐ - Defeat all foes.

⭐ - Collect the hidden treasure.

Having more stars proves your mastery 🎖️ in the game so, collect them all 💰
